This software, like the human mind, is a community effort.

This means that if you use it, it is your responsibility to learn how to
maintain, repair, and protect both it and the surrounding community and
environment that build it.

Everything that is here, is here for a good reason, but that doesn't mean it is
the best thing for its role.

Community software is spearheaded by the Free Software Foundation and GNU.
Their website is at https://fsf.org/ .

This software is written in Python.  You can learn Python at
https://learnpython.org /.

The code is hosted in git, a tool for working on software with others.  Please
contribute to this repository and document, to make the codebase more
accessible.
